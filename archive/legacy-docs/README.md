# Archived Documentation

These documents represent SpecQL's development history from October 2024 to November 2025.

## Why Archived

**Outdated**: Information no longer reflects current SpecQL capabilities
**Historical**: Development phase artifacts, not user documentation
**Replaced**: Content rewritten for new information architecture
