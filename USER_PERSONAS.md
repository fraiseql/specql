## Persona-Driven Documentation Strategy

### Content Organization by Persona

**For Alex (Startup CTO)**:
- Quick start guides
- YAML examples
- Feature comparisons
- Performance benchmarks

**For Jordan (Enterprise Architect)**:
- Architecture deep-dives
- Migration guides
- Security documentation
- Compliance information

**For Sam (AI Agent)**:
- Structured, consistent formatting
- Clear examples
- Unambiguous language
- Machine-readable metadata

### Documentation Principles

1. **Persona-First**: Every doc serves a specific user journey
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, link to advanced
3. **Action-Oriented**: Show what to do, not just what is
4. **Example-Driven**: Code examples for every concept
5. **Cross-Referenced**: Link between related concepts

## User Journey Mapping Template

For each persona, map:
1. **Entry Point**: How they discover SpecQL
2. **Initial Question**: What they search for first
3. **Critical Path**: Key decisions they need to make
4. **Success Metrics**: How they know they've succeeded
5. **Follow-up Needs**: What they need next

This persona framework will drive the information architecture and content creation for Week 2.
