# Week 31: Advanced UI Patterns & Components

**Date**: TBD (After Week 30 complete)
**Duration**: 5-6 days
**Status**: 📅 Planned
**Objective**: Implement advanced UI patterns in universal grammar (wizards, dashboards, data visualization)

**Prerequisites**: Week 30 complete (Multi-framework testing validated)

**Output**:
- Multi-step wizard components
- Dashboard layouts with widgets
- Data visualization patterns
- Advanced table features (grouping, pivoting, export)
- File upload components

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This week extends the universal component grammar with **advanced UI patterns** that go beyond basic CRUD - wizards, dashboards, charts, and complex data tables.

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **Wizard Components**: Multi-step forms with validation
2. **Dashboards**: Widget-based layouts with drag-and-drop
3. **Data Visualization**: Charts, graphs, metrics cards
4. **Advanced Tables**: Grouping, pivoting, column configuration
5. **File Management**: Upload, preview, download patterns

**Code Leverage**: 20 lines YAML → 500+ lines of complex UI code
