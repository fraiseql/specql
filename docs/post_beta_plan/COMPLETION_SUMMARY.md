---

## ✅ All Work Complete!

**No remaining guides needed** - All 81 skipped tests are now documented!

### Note on Original 8-Week Plan

The original plan mentioned Weeks 6-7 (Template Validation, Dependency Validation), but after analyzing the actual codebase:
- **No skipped tests exist** for these features
- They were speculative future enhancements
- The test suite has 81 skipped tests, not 104

**Actual test count**: 81 skipped tests (all now documented)
**Originally estimated**: ~104 tests (included speculative features)

## 💡 Key Achievements

### 1. Complete Infrastructure Guides

All HIGH priority infrastructure weeks are documented:
- Database testing (Week 1)
- Rich type comments (Week 2)
- Rich type indexes (Week 3)

These are **critical** for production and now have comprehensive guides.

### 2. Advanced Feature Deep Dives

Week 8 (Reverse Engineering) provides:
- Tree-sitter AST parsing tutorial
- Multi-framework support (6 frameworks)
- Heuristic code conversion strategies
- Real-world migration scenarios

This is a **unique** capability not commonly documented.

### 3. Junior-Engineer Optimized

Every guide is designed for junior engineers:
- No assumptions about prior knowledge
- Step-by-step instructions
- Complete working code examples
- Debug scripts included
- Expected output shown
- Troubleshooting sections

### 4. Test-Driven Methodology

All guides follow TDD:
- RED: Write/understand failing tests
- GREEN: Make tests pass
- REFACTOR: Clean up code
- QA: Verify quality

This teaches **professional** development practices.
