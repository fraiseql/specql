# SpecQL Documentation Style Guide

## The SpecQL Documentation Personality

**Imagine**: A senior engineer who's also a great teacher. Smart but not showing off. Helpful but not condescending. Occasionally funny but never unprofessional.

**Voice Principles**:
1. **Clarity over cleverness**: Be witty, but never at the expense of understanding
2. **Concrete over abstract**: Show code examples, not just concepts
3. **Honest**: If something's experimental, say so
4. **Humor sparingly**: One pun per doc maximum 😄

## Structure

### Every Doc Starts with: What, Why, How

**What**: What is this feature/concept?
**Why**: Why would you use it? What's the benefit?
**How**: How do you implement it?

### Callouts for Important Information

```markdown
> **Note**: This is a note

> **Warning**: This is a warning

> **Tip**: This is a tip

> **Example**: This shows an example
```

### Code Examples

- **Always runnable**: Every code example should work when copy-pasted
- **Language specified**: Use proper code blocks with language
- **Commented**: Explain what each part does
- **Progressive**: Start simple, add complexity

## Formatting

### Headers
- **Sentence case**: "Getting started" not "Getting Started"
- **Consistent hierarchy**: H1 → H2 → H3, no skipping levels
- **Descriptive**: Headers should tell you what's in that section

### Lists
- **Parallel structure**: All items should have the same grammatical form
- **Consistent punctuation**: Either all end with periods, or none do
- **Action-oriented**: Start with verbs when describing steps

### Links
- **Relative paths**: Use relative links within the docs
- **Descriptive text**: "See the [getting started guide](01_getting-started/)" not "click here"
- **Future-proof**: Link to sections that are likely to persist

## Examples

### ✅ GOOD

```markdown
## Getting Started

SpecQL generates production PostgreSQL backends from simple YAML. Write 20 lines, get 2000 lines of code.

### Why Use SpecQL?

Building backends manually takes months and thousands of lines of boilerplate. SpecQL eliminates 97% of that code.

### How It Works

1. Define your business domain in YAML
2. Run `specql generate`
3. Deploy the generated PostgreSQL schema

Here's a complete example:

```yaml
entity: Contact
schema: crm
fields:
  email: email!        # Auto-validates email format
  company: ref(Company) # Auto-creates foreign key

actions:
  - name: qualify_lead
    steps:
      - validate: status = 'lead'
      - update: Contact SET status = 'qualified'
```

> **Tip**: Start with the [quick start guide](01_getting-started/) for your first working backend in 30 minutes.
```

### ❌ BAD (too formal)

```markdown
## Getting Started

One must commence utilization of SpecQL by initially establishing the development environment and subsequently proceeding with entity definition utilizing the YAML specification format.

### Why Utilize SpecQL?

The framework provides automated code generation capabilities that significantly reduce development time through elimination of boilerplate implementation patterns.
```

### ❌ BAD (too casual)

```markdown
## Getting Started

SpecQL is this cool tool that makes backends super easy. Just write some YAML and boom! You get a full backend.

### Why Use It?

Because writing SQL sucks and this does it for you. Trust me, it's awesome.

### How It Works

Just copy this and run it:
```

## Technical Writing Best Practices

### Be Specific
- "20 lines of YAML" not "a little YAML"
- "30 minutes" not "quickly"
- "97% less code" not "way less code"

### Use Active Voice
- ✅ "SpecQL generates the code" not ❌ "The code is generated by SpecQL"
- ✅ "Define your entity" not ❌ "The entity should be defined"

### Avoid Jargon
- Use "database table" not just "table"
- Explain acronyms on first use: "GraphQL (a query language for APIs)"
- Link to concepts: "See [Trinity Pattern](03_core-concepts/trinity-pattern.md) for details"

### Write for Scanning
- **Bold** key terms: "The **Trinity Pattern** uses three identifiers"
- *Italicize* emphasis: "This approach *scales better*"
- `Code` for technical terms: "Use the `email` rich type"
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- Bullet points for lists

## Persona-Specific Guidelines

### For Alex (Startup CTO)
- Focus on speed and simplicity
- Emphasize time savings
- Show concrete examples
- Minimize technical depth

### For Jordan (Enterprise Architect)
- Include security considerations
- Show compliance features
- Provide migration paths
- Address scalability concerns

### For Taylor (Migration Specialist)
- Detail language-specific support
- Show before/after examples
- Include compatibility notes
- Provide assessment frameworks

### For Casey (Contributor)
- Include technical details
- Link to source code
- Show extension points
- Provide testing guidance

## Tools and Validation

### Writing Tools
- **VSCode** with Markdownlint extension
- **Grammarly** for grammar and style
- **Hemingway Editor** for readability
- **Markdown Table Generator** for complex tables

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All headers use sentence case
- [ ] All code blocks have language tags
- [ ] All links are relative and working
- [ ] All examples are copy-paste runnable
- [ ] Active voice throughout
- [ ] No unexplained jargon
- [ ] Consistent callout usage
- [ ] Persona-appropriate tone
